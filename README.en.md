#### About
- Most of the style class names in this style library are separated and encapsulated, and most of the class names are presented as the abbreviation of the full name of the prototype style or pronunciation abbreviation, which is easy to get started quickly.
- The advantages of this style library: Class names wrapped separately provide high combination flexibility, code readability, and later maintainability.
- The drawbacks are also obvious: Some tags may require a lots of class names to meet specific styling requirements of the demander.
